## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in computer science, software engineering, or related fields. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my work on various data structures and algorithms, which I have encountered in my studies and practical projects.

Each data structure and algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, code implementations, and examples to help you understand their usage and importance.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


- The `data-structures` directory contains implementations and explanations for various data structures.
- The `algorithms` directory includes implementations and explanations for common algorithms.
- Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file with an introduction to the respective data structure or algorithm, along with links to relevant code and explanations.
- The `LICENSE` file specifies the license under which this repository is distributed.
